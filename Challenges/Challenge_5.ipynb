    "### Instructions:\n",
    "#### 1. Create a New Notebook in ucsl sub-directory in your home directory. (After you login to jupyter hub, select homedirs, then select your net id and create a directory by the name ucsl, if it doesn't exist).\n",
    "#### 2. Name of your notebook should be \"Challenge_5_Solutions\" (without the quotes) and answer the challenges in it.\n",
    "#### 3. If you name your notebook anything other than above, you will not be graded.\n",
    "#### 4. Try not to miss the deadline. If you miss the deadline, let the TA know. Your finall score will be affected!\n",
    "#### 5. Plagiarism will not be tolerated."

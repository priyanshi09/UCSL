    "If you've done any programming before, there's no doubt you've come across a for loop or an equivalent to it. In Python, they work a little differently. Basically, any object with an iterable method can be used in a for loop in Python. Even strings, despite not having an iterable method - but we'll not get on to that here. Having an iterable method basically means that the data can be presented in list form, where there's multiple values in an orderly fashion. You can define your own iterables by creating an object with next() and iter() methods (We will use this in later parts of the module). This means that you'll rarely be dealing with raw numbers when it comes to for loops in Python - great for just about anyone!\n",

The difference is very subtle but important based on what you are using it for. You will observe that `xrange` is used more frequently than the `range` function and the reason is resource usage. `xrange` generates (technically evaluates lazily) the numbers as needed whereas `range` creates the list of all the numbers at once. This means that using `xrange` less memory is used. However important point to note is that since the `generators` are stateless, you have to iterate or evaluate everytime you use `xrange`\n",

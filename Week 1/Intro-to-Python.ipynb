It is ranked among the [`top 5 programming languages`](spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-10-programming-languages \"Python is ranked 5th in the world\") in the world. It can be used to create many things including web applications, desktop applications as scripting interpreter and many more.  There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.\n"

It comes in handy especially when we import 3rd party packages like numpy and matplotlib which has hundreds of methods. IPython also has a set of pre-defined functions that you can call with a command line style syntax. One of the functions that you will find useful in debugging the errors in your code is %debug which will take you into python debugger and you can examine the source of your error. Also in your higher classes one of the function that you will be using is %timeit which basically measures the time that is required by your code to execute. You can check out more features of IPython on its webpage: [`IPython.org`](http://www.ipython.org 'Ipython Homepage')\"\n",
